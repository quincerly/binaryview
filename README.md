# binaryview

This is the close binary star visualisation program I wrote during my PhD.

It should be working when I merge it into master.

# Build and install

This depends on <a href="https://github.com/quincerly/libbinary" target="_blank">https://github.com/quincerly/libbinary</a>. Install that first.

Install dependencies. In Ubuntu 14.04 I needed to add these

    sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libtiff5-dev libxmu-dev libxmu6

Compile and install

    make
